# DarkEden-Client-on-Linux
Run your darkeden client on linux.

Copy ```start.sh``` to your client folder, give permission:
```sh
$ chmod +x start.sh
```

And just run (sudo password will be asked):
```sh
./start.sh
```

 - TO-DO: Text is a mess. Fix this (maybe with https://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=919).
